# CISS-350-QuadTree
This was a project for CISS 350 Advanced Alg. & Data Structures.
The project was developed in VMware Fedora 25.

# Goal 
The goal of this project was to implement a QuadTree in C++ using the SDL library. My implementation demonstrates what a QuadTree looks like when 1000 "particles" are released into it.

# How to use it
Included in this project is a makefile, to tun this project simple use 'm' or 'make' to complie the code. After compliation type mr to run the program. (This was developed in Fedora 25 using a linux based terminal, most likely will prompt errors in Atom, VSCode, etc...)
